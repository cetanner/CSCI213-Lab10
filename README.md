# CSCI 213 Lab 10: Working with Git

**Author**: Claire Tanner

This is the Git lab for CSCI 213 Software Development. One class was added, `Car.java`,
which extends the abstract `Vehicle` class. The `Car` class contains the following:

- Two instance variables for the number of doors and passengers
- A parameterized constructor that sets all current and super instance variables
- Getters for the instance variables in this class
- A `toString` method
- An `equals` method
- A `copy` method
- Another item (e.g. "A new method was also added to the `Vehicle` class")
